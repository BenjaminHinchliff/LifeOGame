# Compilation
if you've got a mac you can compile it with ncurses and it _should_ (hopefully) work. You'll need Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 to open the .sln file, and the enviornment variable **CURSES** (all caps) pointing to where ncurses.h is, and change . You'll also need to modify the library directories to include wherever the ncurses.lib file is.
